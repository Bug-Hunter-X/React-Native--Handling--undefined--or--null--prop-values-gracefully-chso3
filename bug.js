This error occurs when you use a component that expects a specific prop type, but the prop value passed to it is null or undefined. This often happens when data fetching is asynchronous, and the component tries to render before the data has been retrieved.  For example, if you're using a FlatList and trying to render items before the data is fetched, you'll encounter this error. Another scenario is when props are passed through a navigation system and the values are not yet ready. 

```javascript
// Example: Incorrect usage of FlatList
<FlatList
  data={this.state.items} // this.state.items might be null initially
  renderItem={({item}) => <ItemComponent item={item}/>}
/>
```
